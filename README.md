# WEB-FE-JS-HW3
# JavaScript Concepts Blog

## Overview
This project is a simple blog-like webpage designed to explain core JavaScript concepts such as asynchronous programming, callbacks, promises, async/await, and the event loop. It includes detailed explanations and corresponding code examples for each topic, making it easier for developers to understand and implement these JavaScript features.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Topics Covered
### 1. JavaScript Async
Explanation of how asynchronous programming works in JavaScript, allowing other tasks to run while waiting for operations to complete.

### 2. Callback
Detailed information on callback functions, which are passed as arguments to other functions and executed once a task is completed.

### 3. Promise
Introduction to promises, used to handle asynchronous code more efficiently, allowing for cleaner and more manageable code.

### 4. Async/Await
Explanation of the async/await syntax, which simplifies working with promises by allowing for asynchronous code to be written in a synchronous-looking manner.

### 5. Event Loop
A description of how the JavaScript event loop works, processing tasks from the call stack and the callback queue to handle asynchronous tasks.
